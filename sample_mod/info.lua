Hi punks,

This is the official sample mod for Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate!

It adds a moustache and skirmish mode to the game, as well as a custom chess piece and two new cards!

This is mostly meant as an example of things you can do. Feel free to download it and modify the code, have fun with it!

If you want to learn how to mod Shotgun King, currently your best bet is the Punkcake Discord where we have a bunch of resources and a handful of active modders! Join us at https://discord.gg/NjmypEPHsz

Love you,
